### MVP

_The Stock Picker app will pull individual stock data from an api. It will then render that data onto a separate page that lays out some stats that help the user decide if the stock is a good investment._

#### MVP Goals

- _Render data from an api that links to a separate page in a readable and user-friendly format_
- _Use drop pop-ups to describe what some of the acronyms mean_
- _Incorporate high quality background images that give the site a technical feel_
- _Tell the user a good story about the company through data_
